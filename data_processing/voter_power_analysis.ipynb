    "Many reasons exist to exercise one's right to vote. Beyond simply fulfilling one's civic duty, voting constitutes a way to make one's voice heard, to feel part of something bigger, and to participate in the great democratic experiment. In addition to that, and purely practically speaking, one might want to vote simply because increased turnout [affects policy outcomes](http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/seminars/hajnal_s06.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, every election cycle in America, tens of millions of eligible voters stay at home. It's easy to see why: in elections where hundreds of thousands vote - sometimes millions - the perception may be that one's voice is likely to be lost in the cacophony of the crowd, providing little motivation to head to the polls. One might argue that one's vote only truly \"counts\" if their vote is the one to push their candidate of choice over the brink, an event that many see as far too unlikely to warrant a visit to the voting booth.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this perception may be misguided. Consider this: if each vote has only a one in ten million chance of changing outcome of an election, but that election affects billions of dollars at a national scale, then each vote is effectively \"worth\" hundreds of dollars. In this light, voting is a rational decision per se, if only as an act of charity. This is the argument made by renowned statistician [Andrew Gelman](https://80000hours.org/2016/11/why-the-hour-you-spend-voting-is-the-most-socially-impactful-of-all/).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, using this reasoning, how much is one's vote truly worth? This project seeks to answer that in the context of the 2018 Midterm Elections for the House and Senate."

    "In order to come up with an answer, we first need to discover the likelihood that one's vote would have changed the outcome of individual races. Leading up to Election Day, this perceived likelihood depended on two key factors: what the polls were saying about each race (closer races, and more uncertain races have higher odds of being decided by one vote) and what kind of turnout is expected (races with fewer voters have higher odds of being decided by one vote). To this end, I designed a `Country` object that would read and organize the relevant data\\* into `State` objects, which in turn were associated with `Race` objects.\n",

    "First I looked at the polls for each race leading up to Election Day. I only considered polls that were taken during October or November\\*. Here I assumed that races with no such polls available were essentially uncontested - an assumption that held true in a vast majority of cases, but that definitely weakens the analysis. Follow up work should seek to use voting history for counties as a predictor for races where polling data was lacking.\n",

    "My next assumption was that the number of polling respondents favoring a given candidate would follow a Binomial distribution $B(n, p)$ where $n$ is the number of polling samples and $p$ is the probability of any voter casting a vote for the given candidate.
